# Shiksha
Shiksha is an application developed using Flask and SQLAlchemy to aid schools to conduct online classes during the COVID-19 pandemic, where teachers upload the materials as drive links with restricted access to students. Attendance is also marked for each of the materials course-wise, later consolidated into a report for teacherâ€™s convenience.
